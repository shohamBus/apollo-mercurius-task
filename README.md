Obtaining and Validating the Google Access Token

Steps:
1-User requests access to the application.
2-Application redirects the user to Google for authentication.
3-User authenticates with Google.
4-Google redirects the user back to the application with an authorization code.
5-The application exchanges the authorization code for an access token.
6-The application validates the access token.

Sequence Diagram:
•	participant User
•	participant Application
•	participant Google

User->>Application: Request access
Application->>Google: Redirect for authentication
Google->>User: Authentication
User->>Google: Grant permission
Google->>Application: Redirect with authorization code
Application->>Google: Exchange code for access token
Google->>Application: Access token
Application->>Google: Validate token
Google->>Application: Token validation result
Application->>User: Access granted/denied
Backend Service Interactions with Google Calendar and Google People APIs

Steps:
1-Backend service receives a request for calendar or people data.
2-Backend service checks if the request includes a valid access token.
3-If the token is valid, the service interacts with the respective Google API.
4-Google API responds with the requested data.
5-The backend service processes and returns the data to the client.

Sequence Diagram:
•	participant Client
•	participant Backend
•	participant Google

Client->>Backend: Request for calendar/people data
Backend->>Backend: Validate access token
alt Valid token
Backend->>Google: Request data
Google->>Backend: Respond with data
Backend->>Client: Return data
else Invalid token
Backend->>Client: Unauthorized response
end
These are simplified representations of the flows. You might need to adjust them according to the specific implementation details and interactions in your project.




Source Code Organization:

1)Services: Separate folders for the backend services interacting with Google Calendar and Google People APIs.
•	Each service folder should contain the source code for its functionality, including schema definitions, resolvers, and any helper functions.
2)Gateway Setup: This would be your main Express application acting as a gateway for both services.
•	index.ts or app.ts file for setting up the Express server.
•	Configuration files (e.g., .env) for environment variables.
•	Middleware folder (if any).
3)Sequence Diagrams: Include sequence diagram files illustrating the authentication flow and API data fetching flows.
Documentation:

1)Setup Instructions:
•	Environment setup (Node.js, npm/yarn installation).
•	Installation steps for dependencies (npm install or yarn install).
•	Configuration (e.g., setting up environment variables).
2)Usage Examples:
•	How to start the gateway and services.
•	Sample requests to the gateway (e.g., using cURL or Postman) to authenticate and fetch data from Google Calendar and Google People APIs.
3)Sequence Diagrams:
•	Include the sequence diagrams for both authentication and API data fetching flows.
4)API Documentation:
•	Endpoint details (e.g., /graphql for GraphQL endpoint).
•	Description of available queries/mutations.
•	Required parameters and expected responses.


Setup Instructions (setup.md):
## Setup Instructions

1. Install Node.js and npm: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Clone the repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
5. Create a `.env` file and configure the required environment variables.
6. Start the gateway and services using `npm start`.


Usage Examples (usage.md):	
## Usage Examples

### Authenticating with Google

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2. You will be redirected to Google for authentication.
3. Grant the required permissions.
4. Upon successful authentication, you will be redirected back to the application.

### Fetching Calendar Data

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/graphql \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query":"{ events { id, summary, location, organizer { email, displayName } } }"}'
